- 👋 Hi, I’m @devops-blinkingboxes
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - all the things (this can be problematic but such is life).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - all the soft skills that I skated around for the last 10 years of my career
  - C/C++
  - ways to collaborate more effectively to be able to dream bigger and bring ever-larger projects to life
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - anything! That's a bit broad- one of my favorite projects that I'd like to contribute to and still haven't is Netmiko. Otherwise most of my collabs are during work hours and outside of work tbh I'm just trying to go for a hike or go climb big rocks.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - you'll have better luck looking for drew@blinkingboxes.com since that is my actual communications channel and devops@ is an alter-ego created solely for clean separation here.
